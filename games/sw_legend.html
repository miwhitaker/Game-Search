                No kingdom. No memories. After a 100-year slumber, Link wakes up alone in a world he no
                longer remembers. Now the legendary hero must explore a vast and dangerous land and regain 
                his memories before Hyrule is lost forever. Armed only with what he can scavenge, Link sets 
                out to find answers and the resources needed to survive.

                A mysterious tablet with a glowing center, Link doesn’t recall seeing anything like it 
                before, and yet there's something familiar about it.

                With this much real estate to explore, Link will need some help in his travels. Luckily, 
                there are plenty of transportation options to unlock. Link can cover a lot of ground quickly 
                on horseback, navigate the waters of Hyrule on a raft, or hit the slopes and surf down a
                mountain on his shield. And the sky’s the limit when Links soars through the sky with his 
                paraglider.
