# Game-Search
This is a website allowing a user to search for games by specific systems and gameplay features.

It is easy to search online for information, pricing, etc. for a game for whatever system you own,
but I have not found a website allowing one to find a game that has specific gameplay features. For
example, you want to find new games that support online co-op play with a friend who lives out of
state. The only way I've seen to do this is to look through lists of games and research each one
individually to find out if they support online co-op play, which takes a considerable amount of 
time to do. This website allows the user to specify individual gameplay features up front, then
research only those games to save time.

User stories:

1.) AS A gamer, I WANT TO access an app that shows me what games are available in online coop mode
    SO THAT I can figure out what game(s) to buy quickly.
    
2.) AS A father of a young child, I WANT TO see how many players can play a game and its ESRB Rating,
    SO THAT I can ensure the content is appropriate for children of X age.
    
3.) AS A gamer developer, I WANT TO see a website that advertises the games I created 
    SO THAT I can inform games what products we have created.
