# Game-Search

Created by: Michael Whitaker

This is a website allowing a user to search for games by specific systems and gameplay features. The homepage (index.html) contains three dropdown menus to select the game, genre and specific features followed by a submit button. Next next screen filters the results based on input selections and contains links to info about each game. Clicking on an individual link sends you to an information page about each game.

User stories:

1.) AS A gamer, I WANT TO access an app that shows me what games are available in online coop mode
    SO THAT I can figure out what game(s) to buy quickly.
    
2.) AS A father of a young child, I WANT TO see how many players can play a game and its ESRB Rating,
    SO THAT I can ensure the content is appropriate for children of X age.
    
3.) AS A gamer developer, I WANT TO see a website that advertises the games I created 
    SO THAT I can inform games what products we have created.

Technologies used:
HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

Ways to improve:
The list of games is quite limited right now, a larger library is needed before this app is all that useful. It would also be better if the individual game screen was a static display and it sent queries to a database to pull in individual game information. That would reduce load time and vastly increase the number of games that I could display. At this time, I need to learn more languages to do that effectively.
